# H1 Online Quiz

The goal of this assignment required making an online quiz for computer programmers using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The following were required in this assignment:

1. This assignment required programming a site that listed up to 5 questions multiple choice.
2. This assignment required use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
3. In Javascript I added a timing function which times users taking the quiz.
4. Initially I put the radio buttons in HTML and then moved the questions into Javascript.
5. I added event listeners to all of the variables to generate DOM elements.
6. I then set a high score array, created an array to shuffle the questions and finally programmed the questions with multiple choice options in Javascript.
7. I used office hours and help from the TAs and a tutor for feedback on the CSS file for this project.

To begin I built the basic script in an HTML file. I then added the CSS code and Javascript code to those files and sourced them into the HTML file. I built the questions and functons to answer the questions using Javascript.
